	<h1>6 Reasons Why Cars are More Important to People Than You Might Think</h1>
		<h3>1. Freedom</h3>
	<p>
		We take our vehicles for granted, because without them, we’d be stuck in one place. Sure, there’s public transportation in most metropolitan areas that people can use, but even then, you’re at the whim of the routes and the schedule of the drivers.<br>

        Our cars allow us to get to places whenever we want, on our own terms. Whether it’s a weekend camping trip or a late night drive-thru excursion, cars give us the freedom that all humans naturally crave.

	</p>

<div class="text">
		<h3>2. We spend so much time in them</h3>
	<p>
		According to a study done by the Harvard Health Watch, the average American spends 101 minutes per day driving, which is likely similar to other countries where people commute to work.<br>

       With that much time spent in your vehicle, it becomes an important part of our lives. Think about it; we easily spend more time in our cars than we do visiting parents, friends, and for some people, seeing their kids.
	</p>

<div class="text">
		<h3>3. Pride</h3>
	<p>
		There’s something to be said for the pride of owning a vehicle. Even if it’s not new, expensive, or an amazing car by other people’s standards, it’s yours. You worked to earn it.<br>

        Pride of ownership is a great feeling when you take a moment to appreciate it. It’s the reason why garages are built, and why there are car shows every weekend across the world.
	</p>

<div class="text">
		<h3>4. Expression</h3>
	<p>
		People often describe fashion as a mode of expression. But we express ourselves through our cars and trucks too. Businessmen and women drive luxury cars, blue-collar workers drive trucks, and young troublemakers buy older foreign sports cars and modify them to be loud and fast.<br>

        We all think of ourselves in a certain way and the vehicles we buy reflect that persona. And if you think that a neon-green hatchback is the best way to show people who you are, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.

	</p>
</div>
<div class="text">
		<h3>5. Taking care of something</h3>
	<p>
		Along with pride of ownership comes the responsibility for taking care of and maintaining your vehicle, which is something lots of people actually enjoy. And this is by no means limited to extremely handy people. <br>

We keep our cars clean, get oil changes as needed, and change the wipers, tires, and breaks every so often. And it always feels good getting back into a car knowing that you’re keeping it in great shape.

	</p>
</div>
<div class="text">
		<h3>6. The memories we make</h3>
	<p>
		Think back to getting your first car and all of the good (or bad) experiences that you went through with it. Or you can think back even farther, to driving somewhere special with your family or friends. <br>

        We make lots of memories in our vehicles, and they become part of our history whether we like it or not. And if you’d like a new vehicle to make memories in, make sure you give me a call, I’d love to help.
